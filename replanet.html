 <h5> App Concept </h5>
    <div class="flex-container">
        <div><h1>Idea</h1><p><h2>An app that can tell you the environmental impact of the production and distribution of the good's the customer is purchasing; in an attempt to reduce consumption of highly unsustainable products.
   </h2></p></div>
            <div><h1>How it would work</h1><p><h2>The user would be able to scan the barcode and recieve relevant information about the water used in production, carbon emissions and production malpractices. The user would also be able to visit their past searches </h2></p></div>
            <div><h1>Context</h1><p><h2>For an initial design, the product used was a bottle of Coca Cola. All the information was available in the public domain.</h2></p></div>
            <div><h1>Time+Tools</h1><p><h2><p>3 days</p><p><span class="iconify" data-icon="file-icons:adobe-photoshop"></span></h2></p></div>
